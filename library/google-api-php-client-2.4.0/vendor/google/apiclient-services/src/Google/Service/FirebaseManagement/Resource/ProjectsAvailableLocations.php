   * Returns a list of valid Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource locations for
   * the specified Project (including a FirebaseProject).
   *
   * The default GCP resource location of a project defines the geographical
   * location where project resources, such as Cloud Firestore, will be
   * provisioned by default.
   *
   * The returned list are the available [GCP resource
   * locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations).  This call
   * checks for any location restrictions for the specified Project and, thus,
   * might return a subset of all possible GCP resource locations. To list all GCP
   * resource locations (regardless of any restrictions), call the endpoint
   * without specifying a `projectId` (that is,
   * `/v1beta1/{parent=projects/-}/listAvailableLocations`).
   *
   * To call `ListAvailableLocations` with a specified project, a member must be
   * at minimum a Viewer of the project. Calls without a specified project do not
   * require any specific project permissions.
   * (availableLocations.listProjectsAvailableLocations)
   *
   * @param string $parent The Project for which to list GCP resource locations,
   * in the format: projects/projectId If no project is specified (that is,
   * `projects/-`), the returned list does not take into account org-specific or
   * project-specific location restrictions.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string pageToken Token returned from a previous call to
   * `ListAvailableLocations` indicating where in the list of locations to resume
   * listing.
   * @opt_param int pageSize The maximum number of locations to return in the
   * response.
   *
   * The server may return fewer than this value at its discretion. If no value is
   * specified (or too large a value is specified), then the server will impose
   * its own limit.
   *
   * This value cannot be negative.
