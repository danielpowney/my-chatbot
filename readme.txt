Create your own branded AI chatbot for WordPress powered by Dialogflow (formerly API.AI).

== Description ==

A artificial intelligent chatbot for WordPress powered by Dialogflow (formerly API.AI). [View Demo](https://danielpowney.com/my-chatbot-demo?utm_source=view-demo&utm_medium=free-plugin&utm_campaign=readme).

* Create your own branded chatbot
* Assume the appearance of a Dialogflow supported messaging platform to display rich message content. Quick Replies and Image rich messages are supported.
* Add hyperlinks in response message content using HTML markup.
* An overlay can be added on every page to display the chatbot. The overlay can toggle up or down.
* A shortcode and widget are available to display the chatbot.
* Settings with color pickers for backgrounds and fonts, custom text (e.g. powered by) and opacity for old conversation bubbles.
* Lightweight and super fast as it uses the Dialogflow Agent API to process natural language queries.
* Enable the chatbot overlay to be displayed on specific posts.
* In-built template system and plenty of extensible WordPress action hooks & filters.

**[my_chatbot] Shortcode**

Attributes:

 * demo - true or false. Default is false. If true, a textarea is added below the conversation area showing the Dialogflow JSON response data to assist debugging.

**Follow this plugin on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielpowney/my-chatbot)**

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Create a Dialogflow account, setup an agent and copy the client access token. If you're a newbie I recommend you try importing the Small Talk prebuilt agent.
3. Go to My Chatbot plugin options page under the Settings menu, enter the access token and then save
4. Add the [my_chatbot] shortcode inside the contents of a page
5.  View your page and engage in conversation with your chatbot.
